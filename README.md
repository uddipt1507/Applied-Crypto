# Applied-Crypto
Python programs for implementing Merkle trees and its algorithms using various cryptographic primitives
builmtree.py genetartes the merket tree for the number of nodes given/ provided
checkconsistency.py verifies that any two versions of a mtree is consistent: that is, the later version includes everything in the earlier version, in the same order, and all new entries come after the entries in the older version
checkinclusion.py checks takes 2 merkel tree and verifies if one mtree is subest of another tree or not
